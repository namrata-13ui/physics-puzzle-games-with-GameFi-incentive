# SimpleStorage Contract

## Project Title
**SimpleStorage** - A basic Ethereum smart contract for storing and retrieving a number.

## Project Description
SimpleStorage is a smart contract written in Solidity that allows users to store a single unsigned integer value (a `uint256`) on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides two main functions:

1. **store**: Stores a new number on the blockchain.
2. **retrieve**: Retrieves the current stored number.

An event is emitted each time the number is changed, making it possible to track changes to the stored value.

This contract is a simple example to demonstrate the core functionality of interacting with smart contracts on the Ethereum network.

## Project Vision
The vision of SimpleStorage is to provide a clear, accessible example for developers and blockchain enthusiasts to understand the fundamentals of smart contracts. With a focus on simplicity, the contract serves as a stepping stone for more complex decentralized applications (dApps). 

We aim to enhance the understanding of how data is stored on the blockchain and introduce developers to core concepts such as smart contract events, state management, and the interaction between smart contracts and Ethereum nodes.

## Key Features
- **Simple and intuitive interface**: Easily store and retrieve a number on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Event Logging**: Emits a `NumberChanged` event whenever the stored number is updated, allowing dApps to react to changes.
- **Public accessibility**: Functions are publicly accessible for anyone to interact with the contract.
- **Gas Efficiency**: The contract is optimized for minimal gas usage when storing and retrieving the number.

## How to Use
1. **Deploy the Contract**: Deploy the `SimpleStorage` contract to an Ethereum network (e.g., Mainnet, Ropsten, or your local network).
2. **Interact with the Contract**:
   - **Store a Number**: Call the `store(uint256 _number)` function with the number you wish to store.
   - **Retrieve the Number**: Call the `retrieve()` function to get the current stored number.
   - **Track Events**: Listen for the `NumberChanged` event to track changes in the stored number.

## Requirements
- **Solidity version 0.8.0 or higher**
- An Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to interact with the contract.
- A development environment like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SimpleStorage.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if using a development framework like Hardhat):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile and deploy the contract.
